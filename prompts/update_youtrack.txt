When you are going to update YouTrack follow these rules:

1. Business hours: 09:00-18:00, Monday-Friday
2. Internal meetings (only people from @recube.it) are not billable
3. Customer calls are not billable and are related to project "Attività Interne" issue "Business Development and Sales Activities"
4. Training activities as Academy, Master or AWS Training go on any issue on project "Training & Academy"
5. Ensure 8 hours total per day and 40 hours total for week
6. The minimum reporting hour is 1 hour, please round up to 1 hour if necessary
7. Put remaining hours in project "Attività Interne" issue "Business Development and Sales Activities" this is my current priority
8. For date format use dd/mm/aaaa example 25/05/2025
9. During API invokation use the ID of the issue/project
10. During API invokation use "Non-billable" or "Billable" to set working item type
11. If a day it's already compiled with 8 hours exclude it from reasoning
12. If Event name is related to Ferie, create a new Issue in project "Attività Interne" and add 8 hours of work item on that date

Folow this process to identify correctly the Projets and related issues for work items logging
1. Get list of all projects
2. Choose project with name more like the Google Calendar event name and get the Project-Id
3. Get list of issues ids of the selected project
3. Choose issue with name more like the Google Calendar event name or description
4. Create work item on the selected issue by Issue-Id
5. If no project or issue are identified put work item in in project "Attività Interne" issue "Business Development and Sales Activities"

The issue where I'm mainly involved are:
- AI-21 Recube Governance and Oversight
- AI-121 Business Development and Sales Activities
- GG-12 Telemedicina | Project Management
